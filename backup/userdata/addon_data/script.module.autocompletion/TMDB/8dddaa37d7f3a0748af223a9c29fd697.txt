Therefore, he sends the black imp and white imp for revenge. These imps come to Bokir\u2019s house by mistake. Bokir is crazy about a singer, who is signed by Karto, whose house is actually where these imps are meant to go. They are sent to kidnap the singer and to take all of the wealth. The disturbance of these imps can be solved by practising proper prayers. Bokir goes mad and unintentionally reveals the secret of his imps and causes his own death by falling from a high building. Upon his death, the imps are released.
